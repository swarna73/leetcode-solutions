# LeetCode Java Solutions 🧠💻

This repository contains my Java solutions to LeetCode problems as part of my coding practice and interview preparation. I'm focusing on problems commonly asked by top fintech and tech companies like Uber, Adyen, Stripe, Revolut, and more.

## 📌 Goals
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Strengthen Java coding fundamentals
- Prepare for software engineering interviews
- Build a public portfolio to showcase consistency

## 🗂️ Structure
Problems are organized by topic (Arrays, Strings, HashMap, etc.) and include:
- Problem link
- Java solution
- Tags and date solved

## 📆 Progress
| Topic      | Problems Solved |
|------------|-----------------|
| Arrays     | 2               |
| Strings    | 2               |
| HashMaps   | 1               |
| LinkedList | 1               |
| Total      | 6               |

## 🚀 Getting Started
Each file contains:
- LeetCode problem link
- Problem level (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- Tags (e.g., Array, HashMap)
- Java solution with comments
